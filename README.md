# Option Pricing Project

This project implements and explores financial models to compute the fair price of options and analyze volatility patterns in financial markets, using mathematical and computational tools to solve problems relevant to quantitative finance.

## Installation
Install dependencies:

## Goals:
1. Understand option pricing models:
- Implement and analyze models like Black-Scholes
- Explore volatility smiles and implied volatility

2. Build a Scalable Codebase:
- Develop modular, reusable, and well-documented code.
- Organize project into logical components for readability and collaboration

4. Perform Real-Word Analysis:
- Fetch and process real market data
- Use the models to analyze real-world options and draw insights.

5. Create Visualizations:
- Plot option prices, volatility surfaces, and other financial metrics to aid in understanding.

## Challenges:
1. Compute implied volatility from market option prices using iterative methods like Newton-Raphson method to understand how implied volatility differences from historical volatility and visualize it over different strike prices (volatility smile).

2. Extend the volatility smile to a volatility surface, incorporating both strike prices and time to maturity to analyze how volatility changes with respect to these variables.

3. Calibrate the BS model or other stochastic models such as Heston model using real market data to make model realistic by optimizing parameters to fit market data.

4. Use Monte Carlo methods to simulate stock price paths and compute option prices for more complex derivatives to explore how Monte Carlo compares to analytical solution

5. Delve into the concept of a risk-neutral measure, which underpins most pricing models, to write code to simulate under the risk-neutral probability and validate theoretical results.

# Next Steps:
1. Analyze the Implied Volatility Surface (IVS):

Surface Characteristics: Examine the shape and features of your IVS. Identify patterns such as smiles or skews, which indicate how implied volatility varies with strike prices and maturities. Understanding these patterns can provide insights into market expectations and behaviors.

Temporal Dynamics: Study how the IVS evolves over time. Analyzing historical data can help you understand the stability and shifts in volatility, which are crucial for risk management and strategic planning.

2. Ensure Arbitrage-Free Conditions:

Static Arbitrage: Verify that your IVS does not allow for arbitrage opportunities. This involves checking for calendar spreads, butterfly spreads, and other strategies that could exploit inconsistencies in the surface. Maintaining an arbitrage-free IVS is essential for model reliability.

Smoothing Techniques: Implement smoothing methods to construct a more consistent and arbitrage-free IVS. Techniques such as B-splines or kernel smoothing can be effective. For instance, a study suggests that a one-dimensional kernel smoother is a reliable method for constructing daily volatility surfaces.

3. Model the Dynamics of the IVS:

Stochastic Modeling: Develop models to predict the future movements of the IVS. Incorporating stochastic volatility models can capture the random nature of volatility changes. Research has proposed modeling the dynamics of the entire IVS by allowing parameters of a stochastic volatility model to evolve dynamically.

Machine Learning Approaches: Explore machine learning techniques to model and predict the IVS. Methods like variational autoencoders and tree-based models have been applied to capture complex patterns in volatility surfaces. For example, a two-step procedure using B-splines and tree-based methods has been proposed to model the dynamic IVS.

4. Backtest and Validate Your Models:

Historical Data Testing: Apply your models to historical data to assess their predictive accuracy and robustness. Backtesting helps in identifying potential weaknesses and areas for improvement.

Performance Metrics: Establish clear metrics to evaluate your models, such as prediction errors, stability under different market conditions, and computational efficiency.

5. Practical Applications:

Trading Strategies: Utilize the IVS to inform trading decisions, such as identifying mispriced options or constructing hedging strategies. Understanding the IVS can provide a competitive edge in options trading.

Risk Management: Incorporate the IVS into risk assessment models to better understand potential exposures and to develop strategies to mitigate them. A well-constructed IVS is a valuable tool for managing financial risks.
